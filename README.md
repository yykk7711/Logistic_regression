# Logistic_regression

class LogisticRegression(object)

parameters:

- eta, the learning rate of logistic regression
- n_iter, number of iteration in learning
- random state, a number to make the sudo-random number is the same to ensure each execution of logistic Regression are the same


IRIS:
-
The features are scaled in order to compare. 

As there are 3 unique label in iris, therefore, 3 Logistic regression classes are created.

The correctness of the classification will be shown in terminal after execute the py file

Result
-
Result (eta = 0.05, n_iter = 50): 44/50

Result (eta = 0.0000000000001, n_iter = 50): 41/50

Result (eta = 10, n_iter = 50): 38/50
